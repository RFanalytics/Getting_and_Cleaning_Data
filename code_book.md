# Code Book for Coursera Project for class titled "Getting and Cleaning Data"

## Variable Description

The script "run_analysis.R" is run against several text files that are listed and described in detail below.

1.	features.txt
	+ long column
	+ 561 records 
	+ unique measurement name
	+ meant to associate as column headers for X_test.txt and y_test.txt
2.	activity_labels.txt
	+ this file matches an integer in the y_test.txt and y_train.txt with an activity name
	+ 1 WALKING
	+ 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	+ 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	+ 4 SITTING
	+ 5 STANDING
	+ 6 LAYING
3.	X_test.txt
	+ separated by spaces, very regular 
	+ 2947 rows (observations)
	+ 561 columns (measurements)
	+ no header
4.	Y_test.txt
	+ long column
	+ 2947 records
	+ values 1-6, Integer
	+ Integer correlates to an activity for observations in X_test, walking, standing, etc.
5.	subject_test.txt
	+ long column
	+ 2947 records
	+ values 2-24 (subset of 1:30 not in subject_test.txt
	+ Integer - people
	+ matches observations in X_test
6.	X_train.txt
	+ separated by spaces, very regular 
	+ 7352 rows (observations)
	+ 561 columns (measurements)
	+ no header
7.	y_train.txt
	+ long column
	+ 7352 records
	+ values 1-6, Integer
	+ Integer correlates to an activity for observations in X_train, walking, standing, etc.
8.	subject_test.txt
	+ long column
	+ 7352 records
	+ values 1-30 (subset of 1:30 not in subject_train.txt)
	+ Integer - people
	+ matches observations in X_train
		
## Program specific

1.  Please reference the comments in the code of run_analysis.R for details on operations
2.  A file is written to the working directory (from run_analysis.R) called tidy_data_set.txt
	+ It is a summary of the larger data set
	+ Summarized by person, as an average per measurement, implemented using dplr functions for the heavy lifting.  
	+ The measurements observed are only those related to mean or standard deviation, only 86 of the total 561
